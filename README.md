## How to Run This Project

1. Clone this repo or open the notebook directly in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com)
2. Run the cells step-by-step to:
   - Load and visualize the data
   - Train the model
   - Predict scores
   - Plot the regression line
   - To see the predicted vs actual score comparison
